# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning
 
### Supervised Machine Learning
- refers to algorithms that x to y or input to output mappings
- key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn    from

##### Regression
- predict a number infinitely many possible outputs
- attach a line of best fit to a set of (x, y) data
 
##### Classification
- predict categories, small number of possible outputs
- if given two or more inputs, draw a boundary line to categorize data

### Unsupervised Machine Learning
- find something interesting in unlabeled data
- data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y
- algorithm has to find structure in the data

##### Clustering
- groups data that have similiar characteristics together

##### Anamoly detection
- find unusual data points

##### Dimensionality reduction
- compress data using fewer numbers
